First android project

This is supposed to be my inital efforts in Android app development.
Hopefully it will also be a way to get my older daughter interested in development...

This project is a JAQG (just another quiz game).
Do a quiz - record the answers - present the result.

Basic idea is to make a simple Math quiz (basic arithmetic) or (English-Swedish) glossary test. 
Primary target audience - 7-10 year old family members

So far I'm just trying out different layouts for the questionnaires and results.
There will probably be some configuration possibilities to be able to have a set of built in quizzes and layouts.

Further on - an idea would be to update new quizzes from some webservice.

=========

At the moment - there are no fancy maven definitions or anything. 
Just download the project and import in Eclipse/ADT.
So far - no external libraries are needed.
Follow the general instructions on how to install an unsigned .apk to your device.
